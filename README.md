# MIDAS Website Handbook
[MIDAS](https://midas.umich.edu) is a Wordpress-powered website. Since we as website managers donâ€™t have full control over the backend, we are unable to change the website settings of the themes and plugins. Therefore, from time to time, some tricks are needed to achieve what we want. These tricks, albeit not always elegant, help make the website prettier and give it more powerful functionalities. This handbook is written to help the future MIDAS website maintainers understand and facilitate the practices that we use.
